I usually use 3rd party websites to see how long until night time for the plains, so I can hunt Eidolons.  Unfortunately sometimes those sites go down, or have other info that I don't need.  I play on PS4, so wanted something quick loading for just the Cetus time, so decided to make my own.

Nothing complex.  Tells you how long of the day is left, or how long of the night is left.

Example of how long of the night is left.
